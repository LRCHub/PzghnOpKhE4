Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and
jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up
bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in
jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in
Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time
It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time
is a swell time
To go glidin' in a
one-horse sleigh
Giddy up, jingle horse,
pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
(Clock Clock Clock)
Mix and a-mingle
in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock
Ring Ring Ring,
jingle bell rock
Play like a spell
I won't tell,
jingle bell talk
So giddy up, giddy up
Turn it up
fast til we burn up
We ain't ever gonna stop
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in
jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in
Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time
It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time
is a swell time
To go glidin' in a
one-horse sleigh
Giddy up, jingle horse,
pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
(Clock Clock Clock)
Mix and a-mingle
in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
(Umm)
