[00:01.92] Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
[00:07.51] Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
[00:11.35] Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
[00:15.14] Now the jingle hop has begun
[00:29.14] 
[00:18.98] Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
[00:22.75] Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
[00:26.59] Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
[00:30.52] In the frosty air
[00:39.02] 
[00:33.48] What a bright time, it's the right time
[00:37.23] To rock the night away
[00:40.58] Jingle bell time is a swell time
[00:44.85] To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
[00:48.53] Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
[00:52.27] Jingle around the clock
[00:55.67] Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
[00:59.95] That's the jingle bell rock!
[01:13.95] 
[01:03.46] What a bright time, it's the right time
[01:21.56] To rock the night away
[01:24.85] Jingle bell time is a swell time
[01:29.06] To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
[01:32.82] Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
[01:36.59] Jingle around the clock
[01:39.63] Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
[01:43.65] That's the jingle bell,
[01:46.04] That's the jingle bell,
[01:48.18] That's the jingle bell rock!
